Diduga KPK sudah menetapkan tersangka dalam proses penyidikan ini. KPK sidik dugaan korupsi barang kena cukai di wilayah Tanjung Pinang, Provinsi Kepri, kata Kepala Bagian Pemberitaan KPK Ali Fikri di Gedung Merah Putih KPK, Jakarta, Senin (27/3). Namun, KPK enggan mengungkap identitas para tersangka berikut konstruksi lengkap perkara ini. Ali menyampaikan tim penyidik sedang mengumpulkan alat bukti untuk melengkapi berkas penyidikan. KPK tentu akan melakukan pemanggilan berbagai pihak sebagai saksi dan agenda penggeledahan di beberapa lokasi terkait. Hal ini dilakukan untuk kebutuhan penyidikan. Dalam pengaturan barang kena cukai berupa kuota rokok diduga adanya penetapan dan perhitungan yang fiktif sehingga mengakibatkan timbulnya kerugian keuangan negara dari sisi penerimaan cukai, pajak pertambahan nilai dan pajak daerah hingga mencapai ratusan miliar rupiah, ucap Ali. Juru bicara KPK berlatar belakang jaksa ini memastikan, pihaknya akan mengungkap secara rinci ke publik setelah berkas penyidikan dianggap telah cukup bukti. Jika pengumpulan alat bukti kami anggap telah tercukupi, maka identitas pihak yang ditetapkan sebagai tersangka, konstruksi dugaan perbuatan pidana dan 0asal yang disangkakan akan kami sampaikan pada publik, pungkasnya.\",\n          \"Suara.com - PT Pertamina (Persero) mengklaim telah melakukan pengeluaran sebanyak USD600 juta untuk membuat ketahanan kilang mereka dua lapis lebih aman. Pernyataan itu timbul setelah sejumlah rentetan kasus terbakarnya kilang milik Pertamina beberapa waktu terakhir, teranyar adalah insiden terbakarnya kilang Pertamina di Dumai, Riau pada Sabtu (1/4/2023) pukul 22.42 WIB atau pekan kemarin, satu bulan sebelumnya bahkan kilang Pertamina Plumpang, Jakarta juga ikut terbakar. \\\"Itu effort yang kita lakukan. Kita sudah spending sekitar US$600 juta untuk bangun ketahanan dua lapis itu,\\\" kata Nicke saat rapat dengar pendapat (RDP) di Komisi VII DPR RI, Selasa (4/4/2023). Nicke menjelaskan berdasarkan hasil audit terhadap sejumlah kilang yang pernah terbakar, ditemukan 4 faktor utama penyebabnya. Pertama, Nicke menyebut karena faktor lightening atau petir. Oleh karena itu, Pertamina melengkapi kilang-kilangnya dengan lightening protection systems sebanyak dua lapis. Kedua, penyebabnya adalah overflow (meluber), itu salah satu penyebab kebakaran. Sedangkan faktor pemicu ketiga adalah kebocoran hidrogen. Pemetaan ini diambil dari kasus kebakaran kilang Balikpapan pada 4 Maret 2022. Dugaan yang sama terjadi di kilang Dumai. \\\"Kita ambil dari case Balikpapan, yaitu high temperature hidrogen attack, ini juga masuk di program kita. Dengan sudah dijalankannya high temperature hidrogen attack ini, kebocoran hidrogen di Dumai, case kemarin itu bisa kita padamkan dalam waktu 9 menit. Ini salah satu bukti bahwa program kita jalankan bisa meminimalkan risiko,\\\" ujar Nicke. Faktor keempat adalah sulfidasi atau endapan sulfur. Ini diatasi dengan merevitalisasi kilang-kilang minyak agar bisa memproses sulfur tinggi. \\\"Kita sama-sama tahu kilang-kilang kita dengan teknologi lama hanya bisa proses yang sulfurnya rendah,\\\" katanya.\",\n          \"Badan Pusat Statistik ( BPS ) mencatat neraca perdagangan barang surplus sebesar US$5,48 miliar pada Februari 2023. Namun, di tengah kinerja yang positif ini, Indonesia masih mengalami defisit dagang dengan tiga negara. Berdasarkan data BPS yang dipaparkan pada Rabu (15/3), neraca dagang dalam negeri pada Februari masih tekor dengan Australia, Thailand dan Brasil. Hal ini disebabkan karena impor dari tiga negara tersebut lebih besar dibandingkan ekspor. Defisit dagang terbesar dengan Australia mencapai US$400,4 juta dikarenakan impor mencapai US$US$621,6 juta, sedangkan ekspor hanya US$221,2 juta. Penyumbang defisit terdalam ke Australia adalah komoditas serealia (HS 10) yang minus US$135,2 juta, logam mulia dan perhiasan/permata (HS 71) yang minus 93,6 juta, serta bahan bakar mineral (HS 27) minus US$92,4 juta. Dengan Thailand, Indonesia mengalami defisit US$342,1 juta dikarenakan impor mencapai US$898,5 juta, sedangkan ekspor hanya US$556,4 juta. Penyumbang defisit terdalam ke Thailand adalah gula dan kembang gula (HS 17) yang minus US$107,7 juta, mesin dan peralatan mekanis serta bagiannya (HS 84) minus US$94,9 juta, serta kendaraan dan bagiannya (HS 87) minus US$83,1 juta. Dengan Brazil, Indonesia mengalami tekor dagang sebesar US$158,8 juta. Disebabkan oleh impor yang mencapai US$267,4 juta, sedangkan ekspor hanya US$108,6 juta. Penyumbang defisit terbesar ke Brasil adalah ampas dan sisa industri makanan (HS 23) minus US$108,8 juta, serelia (HS 10) minus US$56,6 juta, serta bijih logam, terak, dan abu (HS 26) minus US$39,4 juta. Kendati, Indonesia juga mengalami surplus dagang terbesar dengan tiga negara utama. Dengan AS surplus US$1,32 miliar, dengan India surplus US$1,08 miliar dan dengan China surplus US$999,8 juta.

            "Here is the news: INFO NASIONAL - Ketua MPR RI sekaligus Ketua Umum Ikatan Motor Indonesia (IMI) dan Wakil Ketua Umum Partai Golkar Bambang Soesatyo diangkat sebagai Ketua Dewan Pembina Harley Davidson Club Indonesia (HDCI) periode 2023-2028.Bamsoet berharap HDCI akan tetap konsisten mempertahankan citra positif yang telah dibangun. Sehingga, dapat menginspirasi klub-klub otomotif lainnya untuk memberikan kontribusi terbaik bagi kehidupan sosial kemasyarakatan.\"Selamat kepada sahabat saya Ahmad Sahroni yang telah terpilih sebagai Ketua Umum HDCI periode 2023-2028 pada Musyawarah Nasional Luar Biasa tanggal 27-28 Januari 2023 di Bali,\" kata Bamsoet saat membuka Rapat Kerja Nasional (Rakernas) HDCI dan pelantikan pengurus pusat HDCI periode 2023-2028 di Semarang, Jumat malam, 3 Maret 2023.Bamsoet yakin dan percaya dengan pengalaman dan wawasan organisasi yang luas, kemampuan membangun networking yang handal, serta kecintaan yang tulus pada dunia otomotif, Ahmad Sahroni memiliki segala kualifikasi. \"Dan kompetensi yang dibutuhkan untuk memimpin dan memajukan organisasi HDCI,\" ujar Bamsoet.Hadir antara lain Ketua Umum HDCI Ahmad Sahroni, Kakorlantas Polri Irjen Pol. Firman Santyabudi, Wakapolda Jawa Tengah Brigjen Pol. Abiyoso Seno Aji, Dirjen Administrasi Hukum Umum Kemenkumham Cahyo Rahadian Muzhar, Kajati DKI Jakarta Reda Manthovani dan Kajati Jawa Tengah I Made Suarnawan.Ketua DPR RI ke-20 dan mantan Ketua Komisi III DPR RI bidang Hukum, HAM, dan Keamanan ini menjelaskan, sejak didirikan pada 28 Mei 1990, HDCI terus tumbuh dan berkembang hingga memiliki puluhan ribu anggota yang tersebar di seluruh wilayah nusantara. Namun, HDCI 'besar' bukan hanya karena jumlah anggotanya.Tapi, karena kiprah dan kontribusinya dalam kehidupan masyarakat, khususnya melalui berbagai aksi sosial kemanusiaan yang diprakarsainya. \"Pada berbagai event yang diselenggarakan oleh HDCI, hampir selalu dibarengi dengan agenda bakti sosial. Bahkan pada acara pelantikan pengurus dan Rakernas kali ini, juga disertai dengan pemberian tanda kasih bagi ribuan anak yatim,\" kata Bamsoet.Wakil Ketua Umum Partai Golkar dan Kepala Badan Hubungan Penegakan Hukum, Pertahanan dan Keamanan KADIN Indonesia ini mengatakan, kiprah positif HDCI tidak hanya dirasakan dari maraknya berbagai aksi sosial yang dilakukan. Tetapi, juga pada keberpihakan dan dukungan HDCI untuk memajukan perekonomian masyarakat.\"Salah satunya melalui implementasi konsep sport automotive tourism yang menyatukan aktivitas otomotif dengan upaya memajukan sektor pariwisata, sehingga dapat mendorong geliat perekonomian rakyat, khususnya para pelaku UMKM di daerah,\" ujar Bamsoet.Ketua Umum Pengurus Besar Keluarga Olahraga Tarung Derajat dan Wakil Ketua Umum Pemuda Pancasila menilai kiprah dan kontribusi HDCI yang telah dilakukan memiliki makna mendalam, khususnya ditengah masih adanya pandangan negatif dari sebagian masyarakat terhadap keberadaan klub motor besar. Eksistensi klub motor besar dipandang sebagai simbol eksklusivisme yang telah membentuk sekat dan kelas sosial yang membentangkan jarak dengan kelompok masyarakat lainnya.\"Karena itu, saya sangat mengapresiasi komitmen Ahmad Sahroni beserta segenap jajaran pengurus HDCI, untuk menjadikan organisasi HDCI sebagai pelayan, pelindung, dan pemersatu,\" ujarnya.Menurutnya, komitmen ini mengisyaratkan adanya semangat inklusivitas, untuk merangkul semua kalangan. \"Sekaligus jiwa solidaritas yang mengedepankan semangat kekeluargaan dan kebersamaan\".
