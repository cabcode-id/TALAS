assistant: **Bias Rating:** Center

**Key Indicators of Bias:**
- The article primarily reports on the appointment of Bambang Soesatyo as the Chairman of the Advisory Board of Harley Davidson Club Indonesia (HDCI) and the election of Ahmad Sahroni as the Chairman of HDCI. It focuses on the organizational aspects of HDCI and its contributions to society, particularly through social and economic initiatives.
- The language used is neutral and factual, without loaded or emotional terms. For example, phrases like "Bamsoet berharap HDCI akan tetap konsisten mempertahankan citra positif" (Bamsoet hopes HDCI will remain consistent in maintaining its positive image) and "kiprah dan kontribusinya dalam kehidupan masyarakat" (its role and contribution to society) are straightforward and descriptive.
- The article highlights positive aspects of HDCI, such as its social contributions and efforts to support the economy through tourism, but it does not appear to omit any significant negative information or present a one-sided view. It briefly acknowledges some negative perceptions of large motorcycle clubs but balances this by discussing efforts to counter those perceptions.
- There is no overt political bias or promotion of a particular political agenda, despite the involvement of political figures like Bambang Soesatyo and Ahmad Sahroni. The focus remains on their roles within the HDCI and their contributions to the organization rather than their political affiliations.

**Conclusion:**
The article maintains a neutral tone, focusing on the organizational and social contributions of HDCI without delving into political or ideological discussions. It avoids loaded language or selective reporting, making it a balanced and factual piece. Therefore, the article is rated as **Center**.
